The government is unable to guarantee dependable and reliable electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, leading to a crisis of loadshedding. The EFF aims to address this by focusing on clear, implementable, and decisive programmes for all spheres of governance, including public safety, health, social development, and democracy.
